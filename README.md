# Water-Selling-Management-System
Introduction to WBMS.

Nowadays, water has become one of the most essential necessities for most of the metro and cosmopolitan cities. The WBMS maintains a log of all the service gainers. It provides data, maintains templates regarding the quality of the water and provide due payment notification.
It also provides the necessary measures to be taken by the users to keep the water clean and safe. It takes feedback from them and fills up the voids in their services. It holds a log of the city to the places where the water is being circulated. This portal provides statistical data concerning the physical, chemical and biological properties of water. It is also purposed to provide some of the concerning factors of water like the color, alkalinity, taste, odor, pH and hardness of water.
In cities, the population is huge and so are the needs. In today’s manual system, we have a tank fitted in very house for water storage which is connected somewhere to the main reservoir or tank. Thus, everyone receives water on a daily basis irrespective of whether it will be used or not. Also, we often tend to forget to close the valve when the tank gets filled. This leads to wastage. What if the tank stops taking water once it is filled? What if a user can decide how much water is to be filled? And that too by the click of a button. This will help the user to have a better control over his/her budget. For eg. if there is no one at home, we can always send a prompt to make the valve remain closed. And too, from anywhere.

Problem Definition:
One of the most important aspects of any institution includes water management. It is crucial aspect as now-a-days water resources are very limited and nobody can afford its wastage. This project deals about automation in the water distribution and management. Water we use in day to day life is municipality water. Through this project, we aim to make a model apartment in which the municipality water is distributed fairly and the process is automated using our embedded setup. The end user will have full knowledge and control about the water coming in his home. An android application will cater this purpose. The user will get timely notifications and can respond from anywhere.
Objective:
The objective of my project is to develop a web-based WBMS so as to provide all these features at one place. This site provides a central location from where a user can enter the data or the administrator can process the data using different tools available on the web. Multiple users can work at the same time on the same project after getting the required permission.
